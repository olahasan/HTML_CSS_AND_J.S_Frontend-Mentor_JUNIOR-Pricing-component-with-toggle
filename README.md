## Overview

### The challenge

This challenge will get you thinking about building an accessible custom toggle control and also test your layout skills.

Your users should be able to:

- Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard.
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Complete the challenge with just HTML and CSS

## My process

## Features

- Responsive design
- Toggle switch to switch between monthly and annual pricing
- Interactive elements with keyboard accessibility

## Usage

- Click on the toggle switch to switch between monthly and annual pricing or use tap key on keyboard.
- Use the left and right arrow keys to control the toggle switch for better accessibility.

### What I Learned

- **HTML & CSS:** Improved my understanding of semantic HTML and responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
- **JavaScript:** Learned how to use event delegation and manage state changes efficiently.
- **Accessibility:** Gained insights into making web components more accessible by adding keyboard controls and focus management.

### Continued Development

- **Enhanced Accessibility:** Plan to add more accessibility features, such as ARIA roles and labels.
- **Animations:** Implement smooth animations for the toggle switch and other interactive elements.
- **Backend Integration:** Explore integrating with a backend service to dynamically fetch pricing data.
